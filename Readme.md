## Backstory

<img align="left" width="128" height="128" src="./images/apple-touch-icon.png">

I created my first pen about **five years ago**, on **July 13th, 2020**. Never looked back since then... It has been an incredible time for me on CodePen. I had published **62 pens in total** and received so much support from this community that I don't have words to describe it.

Then in 2022, I recreated my first pen: [**Marshmallow Comet Effect**](https://codepen.io/ShadowShahriar/pen/xxZJyXo). I called it **part II**. Now this is hosted on GitHub Pages.

ðŸš€ [**Try it here**](https://shadowshahriar.github.io/motion-trail/)

As most of you have guessed, this pen shows a motion trail effect built with `<DIV>`s. It uses Perlin noise to float around the screen. Also, there are some fancy toggles to customize the trail with shadow, depth, or to make it glow on a dark surface. They are located in the top-right corner.

## Inspiration

-   The 3D-like/neumorphism design was inspired by [**Gabi (@enxaneta)**](https://codepen.io/enxaneta)'s beautiful CodePen demo: [**Some flowers**](https://codepen.io/enxaneta/pen/mJoPgo).

-   The earlier version of this pen ([**Marshmallow Comet Effect**](https://codepen.io/ShadowShahriar/pen/xxZJyXo)) was inspired by a [**Sketch.js demo**](https://soulwire.github.io/sketch.js/examples/particles.html).
